# Minesweaper project

End of course project delivered at the Mines-Saint-Etienne school.

This project was made using Java, and more specifically the Swing library. The idea was to recreate the basic mineswepaer game, with different levels. Additionally, a multiplayer mode was done, allowing users to participate in a competition. The goal is the gain the maximum of points for a grid, where one square equals one point. The propagation of the empty squares was disabled. If the player clicks on a bomb the game is over for him/her and he/she has to wait until the game is finished (all the players have clicked on a bomb or the grid is finished). The rankings are then displayed, and the player can chose whether to play again or leave.
